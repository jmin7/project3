#### Approach:
Our team took the approach of being stronger together. We tackled problems as a unified front. We started with intensive planning, including detailed wireframes and specific user stories. We separated responsibilities within the group, dedicating a git master, a trello contact, and a project manager. We laid out clear end of day goals.

We started with technologies we were comfortable with to scaffold the app and from there moved into working with a third-party API and Angular.

#### User Stories:
We built the app keeping in mind the needs of two kinds of job-seekers. One would be the career-changer, and the other is the career-starter.

Our career-changer is in their mid-thirties and unhappily employed or recently unemployed. They are ready to embark on a new career and excited about their newfound skills but worried about the job market. They are overwhelmed by resources and are looking for an interactive, organized job search.  

Career-starter is a bit younger - in their early twenties, recent college graduate. They are social and excited about tackling the world in front of them. Tech-savvy, this career seeker is looking for a slick interface with great UX to keep track of their job search.
